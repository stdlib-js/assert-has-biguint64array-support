    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# BigUint64Array Support

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Detect native [`BigUint64Array`][mdn-biguint64array] support.



<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import hasBigUint64ArraySupport from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-has-biguint64array-support@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/assert-has-biguint64array-support/tags). For example,

```javascript
import hasBigUint64ArraySupport from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/assert-has-biguint64array-support@v0.2.3-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### hasBigUint64ArraySupport()

Detects if a runtime environment supports [`BigUint64Array`][mdn-biguint64array].

```javascript
var bool = hasBigUint64ArraySupport();
// returns <boolean>
```

} else {
    console.log( 'Environment lacks BigUint64Array support.' );
